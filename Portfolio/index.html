<p> This piece is a massive choose your own adventure narrative project that took roughly a month to complete. It follows the journey of the titular "Journey man", in his path throughout the day, constantly being put down and stepped on. </p>
<iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/dholderman/embed/B2B6UWNQ2"></iframe>	<p> This project was done in p5.js as well as photoshop. It has been coded so that when the image is clicked, it overlays a larger image and plays an mp3 of a man screaming. When combined, it looks like the square guy is screaming when you click him. Humorously, the code counts holding down the left mouse button as repeatedly clicking the mouse so while the image remains unaffected, the audio clip layers over itself into a terrifying result.</p>

<p> This piece comes from my AP art concentration in my senior year of highschool. I drew it using pigma microns, white gel pens, and watercolors, some of my favorite tools to use together. For my concentration, I wanted to combine elements of the fantastical with the mundane, so for this one I wanted to emulate the same feeling of an old medival painting of a knight killing a dragon. </p>
	<img src="Portfolio/Flowers.png"><p> This piece comes from my beginning drawing class where we had to draw a flower still life using charcoal. To achieve some of the more nuanced textures, I also used an eraser to smudge the charcoal.</p>

	<img src="Portfolio/DeskLife.png"><p> This piece comes from my AP art Breadth,and is a still life of my drawing desk at home. To acomplish this piece, I used a combination of pigma microns and watercolors.</p>
	<img src="Portfolio/Blanket.png"><p> This piece also comes from my Beginning drawing class where we had to draw a still life of a piece of cloth. I used a crumpled up blanket at home as a point of reference and used charcoal to draw it.</p>
	<img src="Portfolio/GrandTetons.png"><p> I painted this piece as a Father's Day gift to my Grandfather, who has said on multiple occasions that the Grand Tetons was the the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. I utilized contrasting colors in the mountains and the foreground to bring out a sense of grandeur and atmospheric perspective. The medium I used in this painting was watercolor. </p>
	<img src="Portfolio/Cabin.png"> <p> This piece was a commission I did for a friend in watercolor. I wanted to stay pretty simple with the forms in the image, so I mainly utilized negative space and shadow to define objects and snow.</p>
	<img src="Portfolio/NatureGod.png"><p> This piece is another that came from my AP Art concentration. I combined imagery of a "nature god" with that of a polluted river, and the god carrying plastic bage, presumably trying to clean up the river. I also drew this piece with pigma microns and watercolors.</p>
	<img src="Portfolio/Lil'Fella.png"><p> This drawing was from one of my AP Literature noteooks. As you can see, hes a weird little guy with weird bird hands and legs.</p>
