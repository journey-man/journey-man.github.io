<center><h2>About</h2></center>
<center><p> My name is David Holderman and I am currently an Art/Studio Practice major at San Jose State University. I took five art classes in my high school career, two of which were AP Art. The first year I took AP Art I got a 4 on my portfolio and the second I got a 5 on my portfolio, which is the highest score possible. I grew up reading books like Captain Underpants and trying to emulate the comic style of the series. In middle school I drew scores of comics with my friends which gave me my passion for art and desire to get better. I've worked on multiple commissions in the past, both personal and for commercial businesses.</p></center>
